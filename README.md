## Steps to create slack bot
- Log in to your Slack workspace and navigate to the Slack API website. Click on "Your Apps" and then "Create New App." Provide a name for your app, select the workspace where you want to install it, and click "Create App."
- In the app settings, you can configure various details such as the app name, icon, and description. Make sure to fill out the necessary information accurately.
- Once you've configured your app, navigate to the "Install App" section. Click on the "Install App to Workspace" button to add the bot to your Slack workspace. This step will generate an OAuth access token that you'll need to use to authenticate your bot.
- To add user token scope, navigate to the "OAuth & Permissions" section in your app settings. Under the "OAuth Tokens for Your Workspace" section, you'll need to add  `app_mentions:read`, `channels:history`, `chat:write`, `chat:write.public`, `groups:history`, `im:history`, `mpim:history`, `mpim:read`, `mpim:write`, `users:read` scopes. Create the token and save it as `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`.
- Create an app level token with the `connection:write` scope. Save this token as SLACK_APP_TOKEN
- Make sure to save any changes you've made to your app settings and install/reinstall the bot to workplace.
